Final Project - Hydrophone

The goal for this project involves obtaining raw data from OOI Broadband hydrophone packages from nodes Oregon Shelf, and Offshore. Part 1 analyzes noise levels by plotting frequency (Hz) vs power spectral density (dB) at locations specified as cases for project 2, specifically at timeframes where certain parameters are present. Part 2 analyzes noise levels from Airgun, Marine Mammal, and Earthquake/Volcano noise. Likewise, frequency (Hz) vs power spectral density (dB) are analyzed; as well, a spectogram of Time (s) vs Frequency (Hz) as a color coded heat map. 

Part 1: Four time periods within 2 different node locations
