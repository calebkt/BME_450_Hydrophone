Final Project - Hydrophone

The goal for this project involves obtaining raw data from OOI Broadband hydrophone packages from nodes Oregon Shelf, and Offshore. Part 1 analyzes noise levels by plotting frequency (Hz) vs power spectral density (dB) at locations specified as cases for project 2, specifically at timeframes where certain parameters are present. Part 2 analyzes noise levels from Airgun, Marine Mammal, and Earthquake/Volcano noise. Likewise, frequency (Hz) vs power spectral density (dB) are analyzed; as well, a spectogram of Time (s) vs Frequency (Hz) as a color coded heat map. 

Part 1: Cases include
### Oregon Shelf Surface Mooring *Cases* 
Case 1: Rain and Wind (absent): **Early March 2018**

Case 2: No Rain and Wind: **Late December 2018**

Case 3: Rain and no Wind: **Late May 2018**

Case 4: Rain and Wind: **Early to Mid March 2018**

### Oregon Offshore Mooring *Cases*
Case 1: Rain and Wind (absent): **Early April 2018**

Case 2: No Rain and Wind: **Late September 2018**

Case 3: Rain and no Wind: **Early September 2018**

Case 4: Rain and Wind: **Early December 2018**
